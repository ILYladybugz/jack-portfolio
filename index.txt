About me

Need a great hire? I can Help You!

 Hi! I’m Sherie Kimble. I am currently a Medicare analyist for a software company. I work from home on the beautiful Oregon coast.
I like to solve puzzles and learn new things. I have a web development degree which has allowed me to play in a lot of different sandboxes.
Most recently, I completed a Google Data Analyitics course which helped me brush up on my skills.

Hire me




# SKILLS

My skills

What do I do as a Medicare Analyst?

I clean data scraped from the web and do quality checks of the loaded data. I do some data entry.
I develop algorithms with working examples in Excel based on my research into government policy on ever changing payment methodologies. I investigate variances, document findings and write reports
I collaborate with my team to identify and resolve payment issues for hospitals in their predictive pricing and modeling needs for revenue recovery.
